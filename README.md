# Face-Mask-Detection
The use of facial masks in public spaces has become a social obligation since the wake of the COVID-19 global
pandemic and the identification of facial masks can be imperative to ensure public safety.Detection of facial
masks in video footages is a challenging task primarily due to the fact that the masks themselves behave as
occlusions to face detection algorithms due to the absence of facial landmarks in the masked regions. In this
work, we propose an approach for detecting facial masks in videos using deep learning.
